o	Processes and displays the fetched data dynamically.
•	Dynamic Rendering:
o	Updates the DOM to display current weather information, such as temperature, humidity, wind speed, and weather conditions.
o	Renders forecast cards with icons, temperatures, and descriptions for the next 4 days.
•	User Input Handling:
o	Captures the city name entered by the user and triggers API calls.
o	Validates input and provides error handling for invalid or empty entries.
•	Dynamic Visual Feedback:
o	Changes the background gradient to reflect weather conditions (e.g., sunny, rainy, snowy).
